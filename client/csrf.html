          <strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</strong> is a security
          vulnerability that tricks a user into performing actions they did not
          intend to by exploiting their authenticated session. <br /><br />
          <strong>Why It's Dangerous:</strong> CSRF can force users to perform
          actions like transferring funds, changing account details, or making
          purchases without their consent. <br /><br />
          <strong>How to Protect Your Application:</strong>
          <br />
          <strong>Use Anti-CSRF Tokens:</strong> Include unique tokens in forms
          and verify them on the server side.
          <br />
          <strong>Validate Referer Header:</strong> Check the referer header to
          ensure requests are coming from trusted sources. <br /><br />
          <strong>Relation to C:</strong> In C programming, if someone had a
          pointer to your identity (e.g., a pointer to a sensitive data
          structure), they could potentially manipulate or access your data
          without your consent. Similarly, CSRF allows attackers to perform
          actions on behalf of a user without their knowledge.
